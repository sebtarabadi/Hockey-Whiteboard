🏒Hockey Whiteboard🏒

This project was created by me after learning fundamental concepts of software development during my first year of university studying Computer Science

Hocky Whiteboard is my attempt at applying learnt concepts in conjunction with the introduction of new technologies, namely Javascript and React in which I were unfamiliar with prior to this project

This application allows coaches, players, and anybody else who wants to create ice hockey drills a way to do so with ease.
Supporting a range of utility allowing users to maximise their drill creation, ranging from placeable counters such as cones, player counters, pucks, and more, to 
usable brushes that follow the standard ice hockey drill drawing convention, (e.g. squiggly lines to represent skating with the puck, dotted lines to represent passes, etc)
The application also supports undo & redo functionality along other features such as changing brush colours, resetting the board, and changing the desired rink for your drills.

Featuring a clear, easy to use interface and the ability to name and then subsequently download your drills as png files, this application is a great way
for anybody to easily create ice hockey drills.

Made Using: React, Javascript, HTML & CSS
